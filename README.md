# TRACE template using Rmarkdown

An Rmarkdown template for TRACE ("TRAnsparent and Comprehensive model Evaludation") documentation describing model development, testing, and analysis of individual- or agent-based models. 

My code makes very slight modifications (e.g., a bibliography, different TOC options, and examples for incorporating a figure and table) to the template developed by Richard Erickson (USGS) in his TRACE [repository](https://github.com/rerickson-usgs/TRACE_template).
