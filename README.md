# TRACE template using Rmarkdown

An Rmarkdown template for TRACE ("TRAnsparent and Comprehensive model Evaludation") documentation describing model development, testing, and analysis of individual- or agent-based models. 

My code makes very slight modifications (e.g., a bibliography, different TOC options, and examples for incorporating a figure and table) to the template developed by Richard Erickson (USGS) in his TRACE [repository](https://github.com/rerickson-usgs/TRACE_template).

The example here is loosely based on the appendix from this paper:

McClure, C.J.W, B.P. Pauli, B. Mutch, and P. Juergens. 2017. Assessing the importance of artificial nest‚Äêsites in the population dynamics of endangered Northern Aplomado Falcons *Falco femoralis septentrionalis* in South Texas using stochastic simulation models. Ibis 159:14--25.
